This is a disassembly of an arcade-exclusive version of Sonic the Hedgehog that runs on Mega Play hardware. It is currently not complete.

## Compiling
The compilation is intended to run on Windows devices. Simply run `build.bat`, and a runnable ROM for MAME should be built in `OUT/MAME`.

## Playing a modified game
To run a modified version in MAME, run the game through command prompt using `mame mp_sonic`.
